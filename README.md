  <h2 align="center"><center>Hi. Welcome to my GitHub!<center></h2>
</p>
    <p align="center">
      Hi, I’m Mehul! I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at RIT, blending my passion for AI and software engineering into work that’s both challenging and meaningful.
    <br/>

Before returning to grad school, I spent almost three years at Goldman Sachs, building scalable cloud-based applications using Java, SpringBoot, and AWS. Working on high-impact projects taught me the value of thoughtful design, clear communication, and teamwork.
<br/>
I also enjoy exploring innovative research, with projects spanning secure IoT networks, explainable AI, and tools to fight misinformation online. My work has led to several published papers, but more importantly, it’s taught me to approach problems creatively, always aiming for solutions that resonate beyond academia.
<br/>
Right now, I’m actively seeking internships, co-ops, or research positions in AI/ML or software development. I’m excited to connect with people who care deeply about their work, believe in collaboration, and enjoy solving interesting problems together.
      <br/>
